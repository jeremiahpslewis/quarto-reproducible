## Trial of How One Might Support Multiple Stats Languages in One Book

For a textbook example of phenomenon X, we can use Julia and Python code to enable students to refer to the language they are most comfortable with / compare ease of solving a problem using different tools.

### Python

Snippet from: https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#code-blocks

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

See @sec-ch-1-jl for Julia code.
